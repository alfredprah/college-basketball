# college-basketball

I am starting this project to practice building ML models with scikit-learn. I follow College basketball all the way to High School recruits so I'm very pumped for this project. The data was scraped from http://barttorvik.com/trank.php# 
I will be updating this README file with a repo directory as I progress. 

## Goal of Project:
My goal is to predict which teams make it to the College Basketball Tournament, March Madness. 

Let's do this!
