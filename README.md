# college-basketball

I am starting this project to practice building ML models with scikit-learn. I follow College basketball all the way to High School recruits so I'm very pumped for this project. The data was scraped from http://barttorvik.com/trank.php# 
I will be updating this README file with a repo directory as I progress. 

## Goal of Project:
My goal is to predict 'seeding' in College Basketball. Wikipedia defines a 'seed' as "a competitor or team in a sport or other tournament who is given a preliminary ranking for the purposes of the draw. Players/teams are "planted" into the bracket in a manner that is typically intended so that the best do not meet until later in the competition". 

Let's do this!
