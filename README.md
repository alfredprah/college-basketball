# college-basketball - March Madness 2020 - SEEDING
I follow College basketball all the way to High School recruits so I'm very pumped for this project. 
The data was scraped from http://barttorvik.com/trank.php# 
I will be updating this README file with a repo directory as I progress. 

## Goal of Project:
My goal is to predict 'seeding' for this year's College Basketball season (March Madness).

Every year, at the end of the Regular Season of College Basketball, the top teams get to compete in a tournament popularly referred to as "March Madness". The teams are matched according to a system known as "Seeding". The goal of seeding is to ensure that the best teams do not meet until later in the competition".  

The seed number given to any team in the tournament ranges from 1 - 16. 

Let's do this!
